# autotyper
Python script for autotyping i made for bypassing a website blocker because i just wanted to change the settings and reduce the available time for websites. I say i built it but i just yanked the code from some guy on google. cred Pranjal Srivastava. to run do python3 autotyper.py in terminal while in folder. I intend to learn more with this. By adding gui and other cool settings. Perhaps use this as the basis for other programs! This is exciting.
